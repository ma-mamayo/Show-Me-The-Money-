# Cloud-exit Strategy
## 1. Assessment and Planning
### Goals
- Ensure minimal disruption to operations.
- Maintain data integrity and security.
- Comply with regulatory requirements.
- Optimize costs during the transition.
### Steps
#### 1. Assess Current Infrastructure
- Document all cloud resources currently in use, including compute instances, databases, storage, networking components, and security services.
- Identify dependencies and interactions between components.
#### 2. Evaluate On-Premises Requirements
- Determine hardware, software, and networking requirements for running the accounting system on-premises.
- Assess existing on-premises infrastructure to identify gaps and additional resources needed.
#### 3. Create a Detailed Exit Plan
- Define timelines, milestones, and responsibilities for the exit process.
- Develop a risk management plan to address potential issues during the transition.
- Create a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed throughout the process.
## 2. Data Migration
### Goals
- Ensure data consistency and integrity.
- Minimize downtime during data transfer.
### Steps
#### 1. Backup Cloud Data
- Perform a comprehensive backup of all cloud-based data, including databases, logs, and configurations.
- Store backups in a secure, accessible location.
#### 2. Transfer Data to On-Premises Storage
- Use secure data transfer methods to move data from cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) to on-premises storage solutions.
- Verify data integrity after transfer using checksums or similar methods.
#### 3. Set Up On-Premises Databases:
- Install and configure the necessary database management systems (e.g., PostgreSQL) on on-premises servers.
- Import the transferred data into the on-premises databases and validate for consistency.
## 3. Application Migration
### Goals
- Ensure the accounting system functions correctly on-premises.
- Maintain user experience and performance levels.
### Steps
#### 1. Deploy Compute Resources
- Set up on-premises servers to host the desktop application backend and business logic modules.
- Install and configure required software environments (e.g., Java, .NET runtime).
#### 2. Migrate Application Components
- Transfer application code, configuration files, and dependencies from cloud instances to on-premises servers.
- Update configurations to reflect the new environment, including database connection strings and network settings.
#### 3. Test Application Functionality
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application operates correctly in the on-premises environment.
- Perform performance testing to validate that the system can handle the expected load.
## 4. Networking and Security
### Goals
- Ensure secure and reliable communication within the on-premises environment.
- Maintain security standards during and after the transition.
### Steps
#### 1. Set Up Networking Infrastructure
- Configure on-premises networking components, such as switches, routers, and firewalls, to support the migrated infrastructure.
- Establish secure communication channels between application components and users.
#### 2. Implement Security Measures
- Apply security best practices, including role-based access control (RBAC), data encryption, and regular security audits.
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.
#### 3. Update Access Controls:
- Review and update user access controls to reflect the new environment.
- Ensure that authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place and functioning correctly.
## 5. Final Testing and Validation
### Goals
- Validate that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Ensure readiness for production use.
### Steps
#### 1. Conduct Comprehensive Testing
- Perform functional, performance, and security testing to ensure the system operates as expected.
- Validate that all workflows, customizations, and integrations are functioning correctly.
#### 2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Engage key stakeholders, including finance department staff and faculty, to conduct UAT.
- Address any issues or feedback arising from UAT before finalizing the transition.
#### 3. Plan for Go-Live
- Schedule a go-live date and prepare for a smooth cutover from the cloud environment to the on-premises system.
- Ensure that support resources are available to address any immediate post-transition issues.
## 6. Ongoing Maintenance and Optimization
### Goals
- Ensure the on-premises system remains stable, secure, and efficient.
- Optimize performance and costs over time.
### Steps
#### 1. Monitor System Performance
- Implement monitoring tools to track the performance and health of the on-premises infrastructure.
- Address any performance bottlenecks or issues proactively.
#### 2. Regular Maintenance
- Schedule regular maintenance activities, including software updates, security patches, and hardware checks.
- Conduct periodic reviews to ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.
#### 3. Cost Management
- Track and optimize operational costs to ensure the on-premises system remains cost-effective.
- Evaluate opportunities for further optimization or scaling as needed.
